 * next level has same fleet that you exited with
 * allow you to create Ranger in flagship after unlocking it
 * level 2, we exit the meteor field but there are some attackers. you have to build
   some Ranger ships to defend.
   - when you win you earn Militia ship
 * level 3, enemy flag ship is preventing the portal from appearing.
   destroy the flag ship to open the portal.

Bugs:
 * I suspect that physics objects are not getting deleted
 * flagship not showing up in portal / ships wrong size

Nice-to-have:
 * pan sound effects and volume depending on scroll
 * experiment with speed cap on ships
 * if ranger is in range, don't accelerate toward target
 * fix the thruster sound glitchiness
 * State should be renamed LevelPlayer
 * each command should draw to indicate that something is commanded
 * Squad: don't assume all ships have same radius


Ship Classes:
 * Militia: this is what you'll start out with. has short range. agile.
   actually doesn't shoot lazers, shoots a short range lightning attack
   out the front.
 * Ranger: short range weak lazers. less agile. less defense. in a 1v1, a
   Militia should be able to overtake a Ranger and kill it.
 * Artillery: slower, shoots big lazers. slow moving, weak defense.
 * FlagShip: does not attack. has shields. does not move.
 * TurretLevel1: stationary, weak lazers.
 * Medic: heals other ships
