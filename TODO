 Features:
 * Add a command that tells a ship to defend another ship.

 Level ideas:
 * AI sends their army to attack your flagship directly
 * have to travel through a deadly area which you have no hope of destroying.
   get inside a tank to make it through.
 * somehow utilize manual override

Bugs:

 * flagship not showing up in portal / ships wrong size

Nice-to-have:
 * pan sound effects and volume depending on scroll
 * experiment with speed cap on ships
 * if ranger is in range, don't accelerate toward target
 * fix the thruster sound glitchiness
